<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### About The Project

This is my final project after completing the React course. In this project, I decided to talk about my favorite bloggers, since this is very relevant now - people are increasingly going online. I talked about five bloggers. These are completely different blogs - a blog of an IT specialist, a content photographer, a culinary blog, a blog about Italy and Sweden.These are very different people, but they have one thing in common - each of them is trying to do the World has become a better place in its own way!

In this project I used API and Hooks:
* useState()
* useEffect()
* useRef()


Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
